       <p class="intro">
          My name is Louis Capps. I am currently attending Bellevue University as a Software Development Student. I work as a team member at Target.

          <span class="sentence">Currently I live in San Antonio, Texas, with my cat and girlfriend but only recently moved here.</span> I grew up in Georgetown, Texas with five sisters. Other cities I have lived are San Marcos, Austin, and even Fort Collins Colorado.
       </p>
       <p>
          For hobbies, I play video games, am a dungeon master for D&D, and work on a personal game project in the GoDot engine. A game jam has started, so I will be participating in that as much as I can. Even though the game jam has started, I haven't had time to work on it. I can't wait to start though!
       </p>
       <p>
          I also have started cooking quite a bit. My girlfriend wanted to start eating healthier, so we signed up for Hello Fresh to get some healthy recipies. I have cooked in the past, but cooking biweekly has helped my skills in the kitchen.
